My research explores innovative ideas about the many ways that culture is dynamically reproduced in our relationships and interactions. I am particularly interested in three domains of research questions:

#### Cultural Fit
Scientific evidence accumulated over the last three decades has clearly demonstrated that individuals’ psychological tendencies are attuned to their socio-cultural context. These culture-specific ways of being, feeling, and thinking assist individuals in successfully navigating their cultural environment (Kitayama & Uskul, 2011). Following this reasoning, stronger alignment between people’s psychological make-up and their socio-cultural environment (i.e., “cultural fit”) in different psychological domains (e.g. emotional experience, De Leersnyder, 2017, or personality (Fulmer et al., 2010) is often associated with positive consequences. We have recently explored these ideas by exploring links of cultural fit in emotions (Kirchner-Häusler et al., 2023) and in values (Kirchner-Häusler et al., 2024) with wellbeing in Mediterranean societies. 

#### Honor & The Mediterranean
Although anthropological work has produced early work on the cultural uniqueness of the Mediterranean (Gregg, 2005; Peristiany, 1966; Pitt-Rivers, 1966), this region has been relatively neglected and understudied in contemporary psychological research. Honor has been established as a core value and salient driver of social behavior in the Mediterranean (for reviews see Cross & Uskul, 2022; Uskul & Cross, 2019): It has been described as “the value of a person in his own eyes, but also in the eyes of society”, reflecting the central idea that honor is not only self-defined or claimed, but also defined bestowed by others in terms of one’s reputation and status. In our research, we respond to growing demands to make psychology a global science by studying honor and the Mediterranean across a wide range of contexts and processes, such as values (Vignoles, Kirchner-Häusler, Uskul, et al., 2024), self and relationship (Uskul, Kirchner-Häusler, et al., 2022), apologies (Kirchner-Häusler et al., under review), or transitional justice (Psaltis, Kirchner-Häusler et al., 2023).

#### Culture, Emotions, & Relationships
Western and East-Asian cultures appear to emphasize different ideas about how to build and maintain relationships with others around us: Close relationships in Western cultures show a strong focus on the individual, their needs, and happiness, whereas close relationships in East-Asian cultures show an emphasis on  relatedness and social harmony between individuals (Rothbaum et al., 2000). As relationship practices and goals vary between cultures, so should the most prominent feelings that emerge in these relationships, supporting partners in maintaining relationships in culturally appropriate ways. Previous cross-cultural studies have indeed shown meaningful cultural differences in the emotion norms and experiences of individuals (Miyamoto, Ma, & Wilken, 2017), but our understanding is still lacking how these differences in emotions may play out in actual relationships. In our own research we therefore aim to fill this gap by studying cultural differences in emotions in actual relationship contexts of romantic couples, focusing on emotional dynamics (Boiger, Kirchner-Häusler et al., 2022) and positive and negative feelings (Kirchner-Häusler et al., 2022).
